# Yker Butcher Box Order Management

This application was designed to assist with the organization of orders data for a small Minnesota company. This application is a POC in hopes of getting a more general solution to SquareSpace API consumers to assist with their order handling on the business side. 

## How to Use

For a demo using dummy data, you can navigate to https://dry-peak-36543.herokuapp.com/ to use the 'Get orders' functionality and details. Any questions on code or functionality of the backend database should be directed to me: JLeary070@gmail.com

## Usage

Upon loading the page, you can click 'Get Orders' to retrieve orders from the backend server which then grabs orders from squarespace. Each order will have details specific to that order including custom fields filled out by customers during checkout. 

## Upcoming

A custom notes for employees will be next on the features list at the request of the client.
